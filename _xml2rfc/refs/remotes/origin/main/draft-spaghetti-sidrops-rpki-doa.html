  Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) object profile for Discard
                      Origin Authorizations (DOA)
                  draft-spaghetti-sidrops-rpki-doa-00

Abstract

   This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) profile
   for Discard Origin Authorizations (DOAs), for use with the Resource
   Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  A DOA is a digitally signed object
   that provides a means of verifying that an IP address block holder
   has authorized an Autonomous System (AS) to originate routes to one
   or more prefixes within the address block with a set of Border
   Gateway Protocol (BGP) Communities to signal a request to discard any
   traffic destined towards the tagged IP prefix.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652]
   profile for Discard Origin Authorizations (DOAs), for use with the
   Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6480].

   TODO: Purpose - to authorise origination of blackhole routes, and
   signal the properties that such routes should have when received at
   an eBGP border.

   TODO: Document contents - eContentType definition; eContent
   definition; DOA object validation; BGP discard route matching.

2.  DOA EncapsulatedContentInfo

   DOA follows the Signed Object Template for the RPKI [RFC6488].

2.1.  ASN.1 Module

   The following ASN.1 module specifies the encapContentInfo component
   for DOA objects:

   RpkiDiscardOriginAuthorization-2021
    { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549)
      pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) smime(16) mod(0) TBD }

   DEFINITIONS EXPLICIT TAGS ::=
   BEGIN

   IMPORTS
    CONTENT-TYPE
    FROM CryptographicMessageSyntax-2010 -- in [RFC6268]
      { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
        pkcs-9(9) smime(16) modules(0) id-mod-cms-2009(58) }

    IPAddressOrRange, IPAddressRange, IPAddress, ASId
    FROM IPAddrAndASCertExtn -- in [RFC3779]
      { iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
        security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) mod(0)
        id-mod-ip-addr-and-as-ident(30) } ;

   ct-discardOriginAuthorization CONTENT-TYPE ::=
      { TYPE DiscardOriginAuthorization IDENTIFIED BY
        id-ct-discardOriginAuthorization }

   id-ct-discardOriginAuthorization OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
      { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
        pkcs-9(9) id-smime(16) id-ct(1) TBD }

   DiscardOriginAuthorization ::= SEQUENCE {
      version             [0] INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
      ipAddrBlocks        IPListRange,
      originAsID          ASId,
      peerAsIDs           [1] SEQUENCE SIZE(1..MAX) OF ASId OPTIONAL,
      communities         [2] SEQUENCE SIZE(1..MAX) OF Community
   }

   IPListRange ::= SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..MAX)) OF IPAddressFamilyRange

   IPAddressFamilyRange ::= SEQUENCE {
      addressFamily        OCTET STRING (SIZE(2..3)),
      addressOrRange       IPAddressOrRange,
      prefixLengthRange    PrefixLengthRange OPTIONAL -- if omitted, assume hostroutes
   }

   PrefixLengthRange ::= SEQUENCE {
      minLength            INTEGER,
      maxLength            INTEGER
   }

   Community ::= CHOICE {
      bgpCommunity        [0] OCTET STRING (SIZE(4)),
      bgpLargeCommunity   [1] OCTET STRING (SIZE(12))
   }

   END

2.2.  The DOA eContentType

   The eContentType for a DOA is defined as id-ct-
   discardOriginAuthorization as specified in Section 2.1.

   This OID MUST appear both within the eContentType in the
   encapContentInfo object as well as the ContentType signed attribute
   in the signerInfo object (see [RFC6488]).

2.3.  The DOA eContent

   The content of a DOA is formally defined as
   DiscardOriginAuthorization as specified in Section 2.1

2.3.1.  version

   The version number of the DiscardOriginAuthorization MUST be 0.

2.3.2.  ipAddrBlocks

   TODO

2.3.3.  originAsID

   TODO

2.3.4.  peerAsIDs

   TODO

2.3.5.  communities

   TODO

3.  DOA Validation

   To validate a DOA the relying party MUST perform all the validation
   checks specified in [RFC6488] as well as the following additional
   DOA-specific validation step:

   *  The IP delegation extension [RFC3779] MUST be present in the end-
      entity certificate (contained in the DOA), and every IP address
      prefix present in the ipAddrBlocks component of the DOA eContent
      is contained within the set of IP addresses specified in the EE
      certificate&#39;s IP address delegation extension.

4.  BGP Discard Route Matching

   TODO: Seperate document?

5.  Operational Considerations

   TODO

6.  Security Considerations

   TODO

7.  Implementation status

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 7942.
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to RFC 7942, &quot;this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit&quot;.

   *  A signer implementation [rpkimancer-doa] written in Python has
      been developed by Ben Maddison.
