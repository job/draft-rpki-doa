  Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) object profile for Discard
                      Origin Authorizations (DOA)
                  draft-spaghetti-sidrops-rpki-doa-00

Abstract

   This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) profile
   for Discard Origin Authorizations (DOAs), for use with the Resource
   Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  A DOA is a digitally signed object
   that provides a means of verifying that an IP address block holder
   has authorized an Autonomous System (AS) to originate routes to one
   or more prefixes within the address block tagged with a specific set
   of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Communities, to signal a request to
   discard IP traffic destined towards the tagged IP prefix.

1.  Introduction

   Internet operators commonly provide a means for adjacent networks to
   advertise routes in BGP with the intention that traffic matching such
   a route be discarded, rather than being forwarded towards the
   advertising network.  This is referred to as Remotely Triggered
   Blackholing (RTBH), and is typically acheived through the use of a
   BGP Community [RFC1997].  [RFC7999] defines a &quot;well known&quot; community
   value for this purpose.  The route used to signal an RTBH request is
   referred to as an RTBH route.

   Inter-AS RTBH signalling, however, is in tension with the deployment
   of Route Origin Validation (ROV) based on the Resource Public Key
   Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6811].  Because a blackhole route is likely
   to have a prefix length greater than permitted in any covering ROA,
   an operator wishing to deploy routing policy to discard BGP paths
   with an ROV status of &quot;Invalid&quot;, and simultaneously maintain a
   blackhole signalling service must choose either:

   1.  to exempt blackhole routes from processing based on ROV status,
       thus foregoing the benefit of ROV altogether; or

   2.  to insist that users of the blackhole signalling service create
       ROAs with a sufficiently large &quot;maxLength&quot; values to accomodate
       blackhole routes.

   This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652]
   profile for Discard Origin Authorizations (DOAs), for use with the
   Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6480], along with
   associated processing rules.

   DOAs can be used to validate whether incoming BGP route announcements
   carrying specific BGP Communities are meant to signify a request to
   discard IP traffic towards the IP destination carried in the BGP
   route.  This enhances the concepts of [RFC3882] and [RFC7999], and
   can co-exist with deployed ROV policy.

2.  DOA EncapsulatedContentInfo

   DOA follows the Signed Object Template for the RPKI [RFC6488].

2.1.  ASN.1 Module

   The following ASN.1 module specifies the encapContentInfo component
   for DOA objects:

   RpkiDiscardOriginAuthorization-2021
    { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549)
      pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) smime(16) mod(0) TBD }

   DEFINITIONS EXPLICIT TAGS ::=
   BEGIN

   IMPORTS
    CONTENT-TYPE
    FROM CryptographicMessageSyntax-2010 -- in [RFC6268]
      { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
        pkcs-9(9) smime(16) modules(0) id-mod-cms-2009(58) }

    IPAddressOrRange, IPAddressRange, IPAddress, ASId
    FROM IPAddrAndASCertExtn -- in [RFC3779]
      { iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
        security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) mod(0)
        id-mod-ip-addr-and-as-ident(30) } ;

   ct-discardOriginAuthorization CONTENT-TYPE ::=
      { TYPE DiscardOriginAuthorization IDENTIFIED BY
        id-ct-discardOriginAuthorization }

   id-ct-discardOriginAuthorization OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
      { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
        pkcs-9(9) id-smime(16) id-ct(1) TBD }

   DiscardOriginAuthorization ::= SEQUENCE {
      version             [0] INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
      ipAddrBlocks        IPListRange,
      originAsID          ASId,
      peerAsIDs           [1] SEQUENCE SIZE(1..MAX) OF ASId OPTIONAL,
      communities         [2] SEQUENCE SIZE(1..MAX) OF Community
   }

   IPListRange ::= SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..MAX)) OF IPAddressFamilyRange

   IPAddressFamilyRange ::= SEQUENCE {
      addressFamily        OCTET STRING (SIZE(2..3)),
      addressOrRange       IPAddressOrRange,
      prefixLengthRange    PrefixLengthRange OPTIONAL -- if omitted, assume hostroutes
   }

   PrefixLengthRange ::= SEQUENCE {
      minLength            INTEGER,
      maxLength            INTEGER
   }

   Community ::= CHOICE {
      bgpCommunity        [0] OCTET STRING (SIZE(4)),
      bgpLargeCommunity   [1] OCTET STRING (SIZE(12))
   }

   END

2.2.  The DOA eContentType

   The eContentType for a DOA is defined as id-ct-
   discardOriginAuthorization as specified in Section 2.1.

   This OID MUST appear both within the eContentType in the
   encapContentInfo object as well as the ContentType signed attribute
   in the signerInfo object (see [RFC6488]).

2.3.  The DOA eContent

   The content of a DOA is formally defined as
   DiscardOriginAuthorization as specified in Section 2.1

2.3.1.  version

   The version number of the DiscardOriginAuthorization MUST be 0.

2.3.2.  ipAddrBlocks

   The IP address prefixes for which the announcement of RTBH routes is
   authorized.  The IP address resources contained here are the
   resources used to mark the authorization, and MUST match the set of
   resources listed by the EE certificate carried in the CMS
   certificates field.  See [RFC6482] Section 3.3 for a similar, but not
   entirely similar appraoch.  A notable difference is the absense of
   MaxLength, and instead a PrefixLengthRange is used.  If no
   PrefixLengthRange is present, only the &quot;host route&quot; prefix length
   (i.e. 32 for IPv4 and 128 for IPv6) is authorized.

2.3.3.  originAsID

   The asID field contains the AS number that is authorized to originate
   RTBH routes for the given IP address prefixes.  The asID does not
   have to be contained by the resources listed on the EE certificate.

2.3.4.  peerAsIDs

   The peerAsIDs field contains zero or more AS numbers that are
   authorized to propagate routes intended to signal an RTBH request for
   the given IP address prefixes.  The peerAsIDs do not have to be
   contained by the resources listed on the EE certificate.  Network
   operators MUST only accept the RTBH request if it was received from
   any listed peerAsIDs.  The peerAsIDs field allows DOAs to be used to
   validate RTBH routes with one AS hop between originator and
   receipient.

2.3.5.  communities

   The communities field contains the Classic BGP communities or Large
   BGP Communities which are to be the &#39;trigger&#39; to start RTBH.  TBD:
   are communities &#39;and&#39; or &#39;or&#39;?

3.  DOA Validation

   To validate a DOA the relying party MUST perform all the validation
   checks specified in [RFC6488] as well as the following additional
   DOA-specific validation step:

   *  The IP delegation extension [RFC3779] MUST be present in the end-
      entity certificate (contained in the DOA), and every IP address
      prefix present in the ipAddrBlocks component of the DOA eContent
      is contained within the set of IP addresses specified in the EE
      certificate&#39;s IP address delegation extension.

4.  RPKI-RTR protocol extensions

   TODO: Seperate document?

5.  BGP Route Matching

   TODO: Seperate document?

   A BGP speaker MAY assign to each path it receives from its peers one
   of 3 RTBH request validation states:

   *  Matched: a validated DOA object was found covering the prefix of
      the received path, and matching the contraints of the DOA;

   *  Unmatched: a validated DOA object was found covering the prefix of
      the received path, but the constraints of the DOA were not
      matched; or

   *  NotFound: a validated DOA object covering the prefix of the
      receieved path was not found.

   Where &quot;covering&quot; is used as in its definition in Section 2 [RFC6811].

   In order for a BGP path to be considered to have matched the
   constraints of a DOA object, the following conditions MUST be met:

   *  The route originated from the ASN listed in the ASId.

   *  The route was received from a PeerAS which is either the ASId or
      listed in the peerAsIDs field.

   *  The route&#39;s prefix length matches the listed permissible prefix
      lengths.

   *  The route is tagged with (TODO: one or more of?) the designated
      BGP community.

6.  Route Origin Validation Co-Existance

   It is important to observe that ROAs and DOAs can and will be issued
   for the same covered address space, and that the resulting ROV
   validation state MUST be entirely independent of the resulting DOA
   validation state.

   In particular it is expected that legitimate RTBH routes will
   commonly receive a DOA validation state of &#39;Matched&#39; whilst also
   receiving a ROV validation state of &#39;Invalid&#39; due to the (likely)
   longer prefix-length of an RTBH route.

   For this reason, it is recommended that operators construct policy so
   as to act on the DOA validation early in the routing policy
   application process, such that routes that are &#39;Matched&#39; may be
   installed as RTBH routes, and routes that are &#39;Unmatched&#39; or
   &#39;NotFound&#39; can &quot;fall-through&quot; to be processed as &quot;normal&quot; routes,
   including the possible application of policy based on their ROV
   validation state.

   Critically, in order that operators are able to construct policy
   according to their needs conforming implementations MUST NOT take any
   policy action on a route based on either its DOA or ROV validation
   state by default.  See also [RFC8481].

7.  Exporting RTBH Routes

   The guidance of Section 3.2 [RFC7999] that, in general, RTBH routes
   SHOULD NOT be propagated beyond the receiving AS continues to apply
   to RTBH routes validated in terms of the above mechanisms.

   The exception to this guidance is that an operator MAY propagate a
   received RTBH route to neighboring ASes if its own AS number appears
   in the peerAsIDs field of the matched DOA, since this indicates a
   desire by the issuer that neighbors of the local AS honour the route
   as a legitimate RTBH signal.

   To facilitate the construction of routing policies by operators that
   implemented this behaviour, conforming BGP speaker implementations
   SHOULD provide a means of distinguishing between &#39;Matched&#39; routes for
   which the local AS appears in the peerAsIDs of the matched DOA from
   those for which it does not.

10.  Implementation status

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 7942.
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to RFC 7942, &quot;this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit&quot;.

   *  A signer implementation [rpkimancer-doa] written in Python has
      been developed by Ben Maddison.
