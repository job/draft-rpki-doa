        This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) profile for Discard Origin Authorizations (DOAs), for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).
        A DOA is a digitally signed object that provides a means of verifying that an IP address block holder has authorized an Autonomous System (AS) to originate routes to one or more prefixes within the address block tagged with a specific set of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Communities, to signal a request to discard IP traffic destined towards the tagged IP prefix.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
        Internet operators commonly provide a means for adjacent networks to advertise routes in BGP with the intention that traffic matching such a route be discarded, rather than being forwarded towards the advertising network.
        This is referred to as Remotely Triggered Blackholing (RTBH), and is typically acheived through the use of a BGP Community <xref target="RFC1997"/>.
        <xref target="RFC7999"/> defines a "well known" community value for this purpose.
        The route used to signal an RTBH request is referred to as an RTBH route.
      </t>
      <t>
        Inter-AS RTBH signalling, however, is in tension with the deployment of Route Origin Validation (ROV) based on the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) <xref target="RFC6811"/>.
        Because a blackhole route is likely to have a prefix length greater than permitted in any covering ROA, an operator wishing to deploy routing policy to discard BGP paths with an ROV status of "Invalid", and simultaneously maintain a blackhole signalling service must choose either:
      </t>
      <ol>
        <li>
            to exempt blackhole routes from processing based on ROV status, thus foregoing the benefit of ROV altogether; or
        </li>
        <li>
            to insist that users of the blackhole signalling service create ROAs with a sufficiently large "maxLength" values to accomodate blackhole routes.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <t>
        This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) <xref target="RFC5652"/> profile for Discard Origin Authorizations (DOAs), for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) <xref target="RFC6480"/>, along with associated processing rules.
      </t>
      <t>
        DOAs can be used to validate whether incoming BGP route announcements carrying specific BGP Communities are meant to signify a request to discard IP traffic towards the IP destination carried in the BGP route.
        This enhances the concepts of <xref target="RFC3882"/> and <xref target="RFC7999"/>, and can co-exist with deployed ROV policy.

            A notable difference is the absense of MaxLength, and instead a PrefixLengthRange is used.

          A BGP speaker MAY assign to each path it receives from its peers one of 3 RTBH request validation states:
      </t>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Matched: a validated DOA object was found covering the prefix of the received path, and matching the contraints of the DOA;
        </li>
        <li>
          Unmatched: a validated DOA object was found covering the prefix of the received path, but the constraints of the DOA were not matched; or
        </li>
        <li>
          NotFound: a validated DOA object covering the prefix of the receieved path was not found.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>
        Where "covering" is used as in its definition in <xref target="RFC6811">Section 2</xref>.
      </t>
      <t>
        In order for a BGP path to be considered to have matched the constraints of a DOA object, the following conditions MUST be met:
      </t>
      <ul>
        <li>The route originated from the ASN listed in the ASId.</li>
        <li>The route was received from a PeerAS which is either the ASId or listed in the peerAsIDs field.</li>
        <li>The route's prefix length matches the listed permissible prefix lengths.</li>
        <li>The route is tagged with (TODO: one or more of?) the designated BGP community.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section anchor="rov_coexist">
      <name>Route Origin Validation Co-Existance</name>
      <t>
        It is important to observe that ROAs and DOAs can and will be issued for the same covered address space, and that the resulting ROV validation state MUST be entirely independent of the resulting DOA validation state.
      </t>
      <t>
        In particular it is expected that legitimate RTBH routes will commonly receive a DOA validation state of 'Matched' whilst also receiving a ROV validation state of 'Invalid' due to the (likely) longer prefix-length of an RTBH route.
      </t>
      <t>
        For this reason, it is recommended that operators construct policy so as to act on the DOA validation early in the routing policy application process, such that routes that are 'Matched' may be installed as RTBH routes, and routes that are 'Unmatched' or 'NotFound' can "fall-through" to be processed as "normal" routes, including the possible application of policy based on their ROV validation state.
      </t>
      <t>
        Critically, in order that operators are able to construct policy according to their needs conforming implementations MUST NOT take any policy action on a route based on either its DOA or ROV validation state by default.
        See also <xref target="RFC8481"/>.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section>
      <name>Exporting RTBH Routes</name>
      <t>
        The guidance of <xref target="RFC7999">Section 3.2</xref> that, in general, RTBH routes SHOULD NOT be propagated beyond the receiving AS continues to apply to RTBH routes validated in terms of the above mechanisms.
      </t>
      <t>
        The exception to this guidance is that an operator MAY propagate a received RTBH route to neighboring ASes if its own AS number appears in the peerAsIDs field of the matched DOA, since this indicates a desire by the issuer that neighbors of the local AS honour the route as a legitimate RTBH signal.
      </t>
      <t>
        To facilitate the construction of routing policies by operators that implemented this behaviour, conforming BGP speaker implementations SHOULD provide a means of distinguishing between 'Matched' routes for which the local AS appears in the peerAsIDs of the matched DOA from those for which it does not.

            <abstract>
              <t>This document describes an operational technique that uses BGP communities to remotely trigger black-holing of a particular destination network to block denial-of-service attacks.  Black-holing can be applied on a selection of routers rather than all BGP-speaking routers in the network.  The document also describes a sinkhole tunnel technique using BGP communities and tunnels to pull traffic into a sinkhole router for analysis.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>This document describes an architecture for an infrastructure to support improved security of Internet routing.  The foundation of this architecture is a Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) that represents the allocation hierarchy of IP address space and Autonomous System (AS) numbers; and a distributed repository system for storing and disseminating the data objects that comprise the RPKI, as well as other signed objects necessary for improved routing security.  As an initial application of this architecture, the document describes how a legitimate holder of IP address space can explicitly and verifiably authorize one or more ASes to originate routes to that address space.  Such verifiable authorizations could be used, for example, to more securely construct BGP route filters.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>To help reduce well-known threats against BGP including prefix mis- announcing and monkey-in-the-middle attacks, one of the security requirements is the ability to validate the origination Autonomous System (AS) of BGP routes.  More specifically, one needs to validate that the AS number claiming to originate an address prefix (as derived from the AS_PATH attribute of the BGP route) is in fact authorized by the prefix holder to do so.  This document describes a simple validation mechanism to partially satisfy this requirement. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t>Deployment of BGP origin validation based on Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is hampered by, among other things, vendor misimplementations in two critical areas: which routes are validated and whether policy is applied when not specified by configuration.  This document is meant to clarify possible misunderstandings causing those misimplementations; it thus updates RFC 6811 by clarifying that all prefixes should have their validation state set and that policy must not be applied without operator configuration.</t>
