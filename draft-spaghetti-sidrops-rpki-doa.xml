    <t>
      This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) profile for Discard Origin Authorizations (DOAs), for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).
      A DOA is a digitally signed object that provides a means of verifying that an IP address block holder has authorized an Autonomous System (AS) to originate routes to one or more prefixes within the address block with a set of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Communities to signal a request to discard any traffic destined towards the tagged IP prefix.

  <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
    <t>
      This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) <xref target="RFC5652"/> profile for a general purpose listing of checksums (a 'checklist'), for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) <xref target="RFC6480" />.
      The objective is to allow an attestation, in the form of a listing of one or more checksums of arbitrary files, to be signed "with resources", and for validation to provide a means to confirm a given Internet Resource Holder produced the RPKI Signed Checklist (RSC).
      The profile is intended to provide for the signing of a checksum listing with an arbitrary set of Internet Number Resources.
    </t>

    <t>
      RSC files are expected to facilitate Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) authentication, inter-domain interconnection provisioning, and resource holdership verification processes.
    </t>

    <t>
      The RSC concept borrows heavily from <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-rta">RTA</xref>, Manifests <xref target="RFC6486" />, and OpenBSD's <xref target="signify" /> utility. The main difference between RSC and RTA is that an RTA enables multiple signers to attest a single anonymous digital object through a checksum of its content, while an RSC allows a single signer to attest the checksums of multiple named digital objects. This difference is expected to represent a simplification for implementers and operators.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="profile" title="RSC Profile and Distribution">
    <t>
      RSC follows the Signed Object Template for the RPKI <xref target="RFC6488" /> with one exception.
      Because RSCs MUST NOT be distributed through the global RPKI repository system, the Subject Information Access (SIA) extension is omitted from the RSC's X.509 EE certificate.
    </t>
    <t>
      What constitutes suitable transport for RSC files is deliberately unspecified.
      It might be a USB stick, a web interface secured with conventional HTTPS, PGP-signed email, a T-shirt printed with a QR code, or a carrier pigeon.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="content" title="The RSC ContentType">
    <t>
      The ContentType for an RSC is defined as rpkiSignedChecklist, and has the numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.TBD.
    </t>
    <t>
      This OID MUST appear both within the eContentType in the encapContentInfo object as well as the ContentType signed attribute in the signerInfo object (see <xref target="RFC6488"/>).
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="econtent" title="The RSC eContent">
    <t>
      The content of an RSC indicates that an a checklist for arbitrary named digital objects has been signed "with resources".
      An RSC is formally defined as:

    </section>

    <section title="checkList">
      <t>
        This field is a sequence of FileAndHash objects.
        There is one FileAndHash entry for each arbitrary object referenced from the RSC.
        Each FileAndHash is an ordered pair consisting an optional name of the file containing the object, and the message digest of the digital object.
      </t>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section title="Operational Considerations">
    <t>
      When working with objects of a plain-text nature (ASCII, UTF-8, HTML, Javascript, XML, etc) it is RECOMMENDED to distribute such objects in a lossless compressed form, and sign the compressed form.
      Wrapping plain-text objects in a compression envelope can help make those appear as a single octet string to any intermediate systems, which hopefully discourages in-transit modification of the file contents.
      The use of lossless compression can help avoid checksum verification errors.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="RSC Validation">
    <t>
      To validate an RSC the relying party MUST perform all the validation checks specified in <xref target="RFC6488"/> as well as the following additional RSC-specific validation steps.

      <list style="symbols">
        <t>
          The message digest of each referenced digital object, using the digest algorithm specified in the the digestAlgorithm field, MUST be calculated and MUST match the value given in the messageDigest field of the associated FileAndHash.

     This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 7942.
     The description of implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
     Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
     Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.

    <t>
     According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
     It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as they see fit".
